Enzyme are widely used in food or drug industry. Its optimum temperature and its thermal stability shall be compatible with conditions 
where its enzymatic reaction is working. For example, a lactase should be thermal stable when that is used for milk production. 
To meet such demands, except that screening enzyme from environments, protein design followed by mutation is good approach. 
Start from a certain enzyme, and select one or two regions for mutations. Obviously, what or where such those regions for mutations is challenges. 
Except prior knowledge, computing-aided virtual screening is emerging and powerful approach.  This study applies transformer models 
into virtual screening to select thermal regions of enzymes.
